## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to skodaconnect!

We have an open source library for communicating with Skoda Connect, and applications of this.

**UPDATE** sept 2024: We have started recoding a lot of the integration and underlying code for the new MySkoda API. This will probably result in better support for all VWG brands and more vehicles, but it could mean a breaking change here and there in the current integration. Don't worry. Your integration will keep on working. When we introduce breaking changes, we will put this in the release notes.
